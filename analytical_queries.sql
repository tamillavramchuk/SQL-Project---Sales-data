So we need to join 3 tables to get the request. 
As we could see the orders table and order_details table have the same column order_id, which we could use to join those tables.
Next check the customers table and orders table: the same column is customer_name. 
And the last one: order_details has the same column product_code as product table. Now we have all the relations detected between tables, so we could join them.
To save the result we could also create a view for this query, so the data won't be missed
