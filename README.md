# SQL-Project---Sales-data
This project shows SQL data analysis skills using a sales dataset. My goal was to create a normalized database schema, insert the dataset into it and extract insights through different (possible) analytical queries.

## Database Structure
- **customers** – information about the clients
- **orders** – information about the orders
- **order_details** – more details about the orders
- **products** – information about diffferent types of the products

## Technology
I have used 
- Oracle SQL APEX
- csv file sales_data_sample.csv, which I have downloaded from Kaggle

## Analytical and business questions I have tried to answer
1. Total number of customers, orders, and products  
2. Top 5 countries with most clients
3. Total sales by client
4. Average price of orders
5. Top 10 products type by revenue
6. Total sales by customers and products + creating a view
7. Comparing average price of each product with MSRP
8. Total sales in each month
9. Type of customers using CASE WHEN
10. Ranking
